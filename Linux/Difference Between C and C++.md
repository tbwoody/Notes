| #  | C | C++ |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | C is a structural or procedural programming language.  | C++ is an object oriented programming language.  |
| 2  | Emphasis is on procedure or steps to solve any problem.  | Emphasis is on objects rather than procedure.  |
| 3  | Functions are the fundamental building blocks.  | Objects are the fundamental building blocks.  |
| 4  | In C, the data is not secured.  | Data is hidden and canâ€™t be accessed by external functions.  |
| 5  | C follows top down approach.  | C++ follows bottom up approach  |
| 6  | C uses scanf() and printf() function for standard input and output.  | C++ uses cin>> and cout<< for standard input and output.  |
| 7  | Variables must be defined at the beginning in the function.  | Variables can be defined anywhere in the function.  |
| 8  | In C, namespace feature is absent.  | In C++, namespace feature is present.  |
| 9  | C is a middle level language.  | C++ is a high level language.  |
| 10  | Programs are divided into modules and functions.  | Programs are divided into classes and functions.  |
| 11  | C doesnâ€™t support exception handling directly. Can be done by using some other functions.  | C++ supports exception handling. Done by using try and catch block.  |
| 12  | Features like function overloading and operator overloading is not present.  | C++ supports function overloading and operator overloading.  |
| 13  | C program file is saved with .C extension.  | C++ program file is saved with .CPP extension.  |
| 14  | In C, inheritance is not possible  | Because C++ is an object oriented language, inheritance is possible.  |
| 15  | Concept of virtual functions is not present in C.  | C++ offers the facility of using virtual functions.  |
| 16  | In C, polymorphism is not possible | Being a fully object oriented language, C++ offers polymorphism |
