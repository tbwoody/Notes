#Design Aims
**C++**       
Was designed for systems and applications programming (a.k.a., infrastructure programming), extending the procedural programming language C, which was designed for efficient execution. To C, C++ added support for static typing, object-oriented programming, exception handling, lifetime-based resource management (RAII), generic programming, template metaprogramming, and the C++ Standard Library which includes generic containers and algorithms (STL), and many other general purpose facilities.              
**Java**        
Is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to minimize implementation dependencies. It relies on a Java virtual machine to be secure and highly portable. It is bundled with an extensive library designed to provide a full abstraction of the underlying platform. Java is a statically typed object-oriented language that uses a syntax similar to C++, but incompatible. It includes a documentation system called Javadoc.
