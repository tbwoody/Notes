Following are common types of binary trees.

- [Full Binary Tree](#Full Binary Tree)
- [Complete Binary Tree](#Complete Binary Tree)
- [Perfect Binary Tree](#Perfect Binary Tree)
- [Balanced Binary Tree](#Balanced Binary Tree)
- [A degenerate (or pathological) Tree](#A degenerate (or pathological) Tree)

## Full Binary Tree
A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaves have two children.

In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
       L = I + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes, I = Number of internal nodes

## Complete Binary Tree

## Perfect Binary Tree

## Balanced Binary Tree

## A degenerate (or pathological) Tree
